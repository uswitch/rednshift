# rednshift for R

Provides a new function that permits the querying of very large datasets (n millions of rows) from redshift.  It's a companion to [pingles redshift](https://github.com/pingles/redshift-r) package which is itself a companion to [Amazon's Redshift](http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) service for R.

The library contains only one function, redshift_query_n.  

It works by dumping interim files to a nominated AWS bucket, it then sequentially retrieves these data sets from the bucket, rather than a single compiled dataset as is usual for a redshift query. This prevents java overhead errors or excessively long waits for data retrieval. Parallel processing is enabled to speed up the process, but it can executed without parallel processing.

## Installing

You'll need several package dependencies.  Most will be available on CRAN and will install automatically when installing the package.  A few will have to be installed from github.  For this you'll need devtools installed.

    install.packages("devtools")

You'll then need to install redshift.

    devtools::install_github("pingles/redshift-r")

You'll need a developmentment version of [xml2](https://github.com/hadley/xml2) to support [aws.s3](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.s3):

        devtools::install_github("hadley/xml2")

And now [aws.s3](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.s3):

latest stable version

    install.packages("aws.s3", repos = c("cloudyr" = "http://cloudyr.github.io/drat"))

on windows you may need:

    install.packages("aws.s3", repos = c("cloudyr" = "http://cloudyr.github.io/drat"), INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")

The last step is to install the rednshift package itself:

    devtools::install_github("uswitch/rednshift")

## Usage

The help file will give you advice on the usage of the redshift_query_n.

    require(rednshift)
    
    help(redshift_query_n)
    
One important factor to take into account is that you need an AWS bucket available and the relevant environment credentials and AWS role to access it.  Note however that the bucket is a temporary store for the data and the interim files are deleted from the bucket in the "clean up" part of the query execution.
